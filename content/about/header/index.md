  Hi, I'm Kayla.

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
My research career started in biochemistry with a heavy dose of organic chemistry and has now transitioned into data science and computational biology. Currently, I'm working on developing machine learning approaches to study complex diseases and traits in the [Krishnan lab](https://www.thekrishnanlab.org/). I am particularly interested in how gene expression and biological processes change with age in each sex and in how we can improve our ability to study human biology using model organisms.

When I'm not working on research I like to read, volunteer, cook, create art, and co-organize [R-Ladies East Lansing events](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-east-lansing/events/).
